						<h2>The Issue</h2>
						<p> The cost of living in London as a student is an issue being overlooked in the UK and one which needs to be addressed. I'm going to show you why this problem should be of concern to everyone of you.</p>

						<h2>Students</h2>
						<p>As London students we are all aware of the extortionate costs of living in London. The government estimates that you will need £104 per week to live in London as a student - and that’s excluding accommodation costs. Of course this will vary depending on the extent of your appetite for raving... </p>

						<h2>Money Crisis</h2>
						<p>So, you’ve chosen to study in London - sounds brilliant! However, you’re not exactly thrilled with the accommodation options available. The tuition fees themselves are overpriced let alone the price of living in London. There was zero chance I was going to fork out another £11,000 a year + the £9,000 a year for tuition.</p>

						<h2>Savings</h2>
						<p>I took matters into my own hands and looked at what travel options are available. £17.50 - per day! Not exactly great. However, I did some calculations and train tickets for the year added up to close to £2,500. I was ecstatic. Yes I know, but that’s an £8,500 saving per year living at home and commuting rather than choosing London accommodation.</p>

						<h2>Future</h2>
						<p>It’s time to make a change. The current situation facing London students must be improved. It is not only an issue that affects you and I, but also future generations which may include your children. If nothing is done now, the future is not looking bright for London’s students financially.</p>
